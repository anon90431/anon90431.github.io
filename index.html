					<h4>Recently, there have been many works towards solving the Winograd Schema Challenge. These works mention the need of knowledge in solving the challenge but do not focus on identifying the different types of knowledge so that specific extraction techniques can be implemented to extract each such knowledge or/and type specific reasoning framework could be implemented to handle a particular type of knowledge. The major works are based on quasi-probabilistic correlation calculus, relevance theory and an ensemble of natural language processing techniques. </h4>
					<br>
					<h4>Though most of the works mention the requirement of knowledge in solving the problem, there has been very little work towards identification of the types of knowledge needed to correctly solve the challenge, so that different extraction intuitions/techniques can be implemented to extract each such knowledge or/and different reasoning framework could be used to handle a particular type of knowledge. </h4>
					<br>
					<h4>In this work, we identified 12 commonsense knowledge types such that about 97% of the Winograd Schema Challenge problems can be answered correctly by using at-least one instance of knowledge belonging one of the types. We also defined a logical reasoning framework to handle 10 out of 12 knowledge types, covering about 85% of the overall corpus. Later we provided an empirical evaluation of our reasoning framework by automatically extracting the required knowledge instances for 100 WSC problems and correctly solving them. </h4>

		<h2>Detailed Comparison with Related Works</h2>  
	  	<br>
	  	<p>The Winograd Schema Challenge is a type of co-reference resolution task. There has been a lot of work already done by the NLP community on the topic (including <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1048">a multi-pass sieve for coreference resolution</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.67.5331&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Anaphora resolution: a multi-strategy approach<a> and <a href="https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14995">Machine Learning for Entity Coreference Resolution</a>). However the requirement to use background knowledge makes WSC different and the other approaches inapplicable.</p>
		<br>		
		<p>Since 2012, various works have been presented to solve the challenge. These works can be broadly divided into two types,</p>
		<ul> 
			<li> the ones that provide a reasoning theory and assume that the required knowledge is already available (including <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/papers/wsc_SS7.pdf">reasoning about correlation</a> and <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/KR/KR14/paper/view/7958">formalizing relevance theory in knowledge graphs</a> ), and</li>
		     <li> the ones that develop end-end systems to tackle the challenge (entirely or a subset) (including <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D12-1071">an ensemble of NLP techniques</a>, <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0326.pdf">neural network and knowledge based approach</a>, <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/download/11096/10846">a semantic parsing and logical reasoning based approach</a>), and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/papers/wsc_SS7.pdf">a reasoning on conditional beliefs based approach</a></li></ul>
		<p>Though all of these works mention the need of knowledge, most of them mainly focus on the reasoning aspect of the problem. Clearly, there has not been much work on identifying what kinds of knowledge is actually needed to cover a significant chunk of WSC problems. Another issue is that the current approaches do not cover a large number of WSC problems (see <a href="#comparison_table">Comparison Table</a>). However, in this work we try to address both of these issues by identifying knowledge types which cover about 98% of WSC problems, and by providing a framework that can process a knowledge instance successfully. While comparing numbers, our evaluation results show that our approach is able to solve more WSC problems correctly than the current systems (see <a href="#comparison_table">Comparison Table</a> below). The details about the results mentioned in the comparison table are also mentioned below the table.</p>

<p>The comparison table shown above enumerates different methods on solving the Winograd Schema Challenge and the number of WSC problems correctly solved by them. However, the evaluation criteria and the experimental setup for each of the methods are very differnt from each other. Below are the evaluation details for each of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Method 1: </b> In this work, the author presented an approach to solve the Winograd Schema Challenge problems by using relevance theory. Following are the steps performed to solve a problem in this work.
<ul><li>the input problem in natural language was translated to a syntactic graph (by using <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/process">Stanford Dependency Parser</a>).</li>
<li>the knowledge needed to solve the problem was written manually in the similar format (dependency parser format).</li>
<li>the final answer is deduced from the representations of the problem and the required knowledge by using relevance theory on graphs.</li>
</ul>
The approach was demonstrated to work on <b>eight Winograd Schema Challenge problems</b> and all of them were correctly answered.
</li>
<br>
	<li><b>Method 2: </b> In this work a correlation calculus was proposed to justify correct answers of the Winograd Schema Challenge problems. This work also <b>assumes that the required knowledge is already available</b> in the desired format. As part of evaluation, the authors annotated the first 100 problems in the WSC list according to their system's format. Out of 100, 72 were found to be satisfying the criteria of the work. This work mentions that the solutions of those 72 problems could be justified by their correlation calculus based system (with the help of manually generated knowledge).</li>
<br>
	<li><b>Method 3: </b>This was an end to end approach. It focussed on a <b>subset of Wingrad Schema Challenge problems</b> which require certain kinds of knowledge. The approach was mainly based on representing a given problem as a semantic graph and use search engimes to automatically extract knowledge for solving the problem. As part of evaluations, 71 winograd examples were found to satisfy the criteria defioned in the work. <b>Out of 71 problems, 49 were correctly answered, 4 were incorrectly answered and the remaining 18 were not answered</b> by their system</li>
<br>
	<li><b>Method 4: </b>This work addressed a <b>set of Winograd Schema Challenge problems</b> by proposing an end to end method for knowledge acquisition and a general neural association model. As part of evaluation, 70 Winograd Schema Challenge problems were identified to satisfy the criteria of the approach. <b>49 out of 70 problems (70%) were correctly answered</b>.</li>
<br>
	<li><b>Method 5: </b> This work proposed to employ a logic for conditional beliefs that is capable of dealing with incomplete or even inconsistent information. It does so by formalising the observation that humans often reason by picturing different contingencies of what the world could be like, and then choose to believe what is thought to be most plausible. As part of evaluation, the work was evaluated on the entire Winograd Schema Challenge corpus (288 problems). Out of 288, the system was able to make decisions for 159 problems under best conditions and it was able to <b>correctly answer 85 problems (an accuracy of 53.5%)</b>. 
</li>

	  <h2>Experiment Setup</h2>  
	  <br>
	  <p>The reasoning framework defined in this work relies on two assumptions, (1) a WSC problem (sentence and question) can be automatically translated into the desired formal representation, and (2) the required knowledge instances can be automatically extracted. In this section, we show the results of an empirical evaluation of the reasoning framework by automating the above two assumptions to a great extent with the help of an off the shelf semantic parsing tool and an in-house knowledge extraction system. </p>
<br>
<p>We used a freely available semantic parser named K-Parser (made freely available by the authors on <a href="https://github.com/arpit7123/K-Parser-JAR">github</a>) for translating the input sentences and questions into the desired formal representation.</p>
<br>
<p>We developed a rule based knowledge extractor for this work. The basic idea of knowledge extraction is inspired from the knowledge hunting work mentioned in the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/download/11096/10846">IJCAI 2015 paper on Winograd Schema Challenge</a>. There are aspects of our system,</p>

<ul>
<li>creating search queries from the WSC problems</li> 
<li>using a search engine to collect the sentences which satisfy the queries</li>
<li>extract knowledge from the collected sentences, in case they contain any</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Because of the limited availability of search engine access and the main focus of this work not being the automatic knowledge extraction, the first two aspects were carried out manually. The collected sentences are then passed one by one to an in-house rule based knowledge extraction module. The module uses semantics (from K-Parser) of the input sentence to find the patterns which satisfy the knowledge types (<a href="#knowlegde_types_detail">Type 1 to 10</a>) handled by our reasoning framework.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
	  	<br>
	  	<p>This paper focuses on the identification of different types of knowledge and development of a reasoning framework for solving the Winograd Schema Challenge. We started this work with an intention to inspire the knowledge acquisition community to focus on the extraction of different types of knowledge that is needed to solve the Winograd Schema Challenge. In the process, we identified and defined 12 such knowledge types, covering about 98% of the WSC corpus. We also developed a reasoning framework which can handle 10 out of 12 knowledge types and generates the answer to a problem if it is entailed by the problem and a given knowledge instance.<p>
<br> 
<p>We performed an empirical evaluation of the reasoning framework by correctly solving 100 (more than currently available systems, see <a href="#results_table">results table</a>) WSC examples with minimal manual intervention in knowledge extraction system. Though the fully-automatic extraction of the required knowledge still remains a problem to be addressed, this work takes us one step closer to solving it by making important contributions towards identifying the kinds of knowledge needed and presenting a reasoning framework that is robust enough to handle the knowledge types.</p>
